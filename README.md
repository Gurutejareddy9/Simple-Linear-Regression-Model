# Simple Linear Regression Model
 This script demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library.A dataset with one feature and its corresponding target values is used to train the model. The model predicts outputs for new test inputs based on the learned linear relationship.

Key Outputs:
1.	Coefficients and Intercept - Parameters of the linear model (y = mx + c).
2.	Predictions - Predicted target values for the given test inputs.

The code is ideal for understanding the basics of linear regression and its predictive capabilities.
